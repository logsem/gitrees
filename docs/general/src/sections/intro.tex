In this note, we investigate the extension to Guarded Interaction Trees to
support context-dependent effects (e.g., call/cc and throw).

This note is divided into a few sections. In~\cref{global:sec:gitree} we
recall definition and relevant properties of guarded interaction
trees. In~\cref{global:sec:lang} we describe the calculus with callcc,
which we study in this note. In~\cref{global:sec:reifier} we describe
modifications to guarded interaction trees required to interpret
context-dependent effects. In~\cref{global:sec:sem} we provide a
denotational model for a language with callcc in guarded interaction
trees with modifications and prove soundness and adequacy of the
model.
