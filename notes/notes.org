* what is done
extension of reifiers in GITrees to allow to access continuation
** language with call/cc + throw :
- operational
- interpretation into gitrees
  - untyped terms
- type system
- soundness + adequacy (using logrel)
  - soundness untyped
  - adequacy typed
- wp rules (for call/cc throw)
  - used to prove adequacy/define logrel
** delimited continuations
- abstract machine operational sem
- interpretation into gitrees
  - untyped terms
- soundness
- wp rules (for shift/reset)
  - used to prove a small example
- some sketch of a type system
  from [[https://www.tilk.eu/shift0/materzok-biernacki-icfp11.pdf][Subtyping Delimited Continuations]]

* what's next?

** TODO adequacy for shift/reset?
- defining logical relation using a type system?
  - [ ] type system
  - [ ] logrel
- OR untyped relation between confiugrations and
  tree state
  - [ ] relation

** TODO more concrete example for shift/reset

** TODO example on language interaction w/ continuations
for example between Î»_call/cc & a WHILE language w/ long jumps?
